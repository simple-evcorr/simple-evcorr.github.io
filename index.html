<h1>SEC - simple event correlator</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
SEC is an event correlation tool for advanced event processing which can be 
harnessed for event log monitoring, for network and security management, for 
fraud detection, and for any other task which involves event correlation.
Event correlation is a procedure where a stream of events is processed, 
in order to detect (and act on) certain event groups that occur within 
predefined time windows. Unlike many other event correlation products which 
are heavyweight solutions, SEC is a lightweight and platform-independent 
event correlator which runs as a single process. The user can start it as a
daemon, employ it in shell pipelines, execute it interactively in a terminal, 
run many SEC processes simultaneously for different tasks, and use it in a 
wide variety of other ways.
<p>
SEC reads lines from files, named pipes, or standard input, 
matches the lines with patterns (like regular expressions or Perl subroutines) 
for recognizing input events, and correlates events according to the rules in 
its configuration file(s). SEC can produce output by executing external 
programs (e.g., <i>snmptrap</i> or <i>mail</i>), by writing to files, 
by sending data to TCP and UDP based servers, by calling precompiled Perl
subroutines, etc.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
See <a href="man.html">SEC manpage</a> for official documentation.
The manpage provides an in-depth discussion of all SEC features and
presents a number of detailed rule examples. 
<p>
Also, the <a href="FAQ.html">SEC FAQ</a> provides answers to some frequently
asked questions.

<h3>Installation information and dependencies</h3>
SEC has been primarily tested on Linux and Solaris, but since it is written
in Perl and does not use any platform-dependent code, it should work on any
modern UNIX platform. SEC is also known to work on Windows, although some
of the functionality that is native to UNIX will be disabled.
<p>
In order to install SEC, check where your Perl executable is located
and change the first line in the <i>sec</i> file accordingly.
For example, if your Perl executable is <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i>, 
set the first line to <i>#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w</i>.
Then copy <i>sec</i> and <i>sec.man</i> (SEC manpage)
to appropriate directories, e.g., <br>
<i>cp sec /usr/local/bin</i> <br>
<i>cp sec.man /usr/local/man/man1/sec.1</i>
<p>
Since SEC is not tested against ancient Perl releases, 
it is recommended to run SEC with at least Perl 5.8 (see 
<a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a> for the latest stable 
Perl release). 
Apart from Perl, SEC does not depend on other software. 
It uses Perl <i>Getopt</i>, <i>POSIX</i>, <i>Fcntl</i>, <i>Socket</i>,
<i>IO::Handle</i>, and <i>Sys::Syslog</i> modules
which are included in the standard installation of Perl (the presence of
<i>Sys::Syslog</i> is optional).
