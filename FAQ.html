<b>Q1: How many sites are using SEC and how can I deploy it? </b>
<p>

A: It is very difficult to tell the exact number of users, because no 
registration is required to download it :-) 
Also, SEC has been packaged for major Linux and BSD distributions, and many
users install it from the package, instead of downloading the source.
<p>
SEC can be deployed in a wide variety of ways. There is a common misconception
among some people that only one instance of SEC can be running at a time
(which might eventually become a performance bottleneck). In fact,
unlike a number of system services, you can run many SEC instances in daemon
mode simultaneously. 
Also, apart from daemon mode, SEC can be used as a UNIX command line tool 
and employed in shell pipelines (e.g., like <i>grep</i> or <i>sed</i>),
and there is no limit to the number of instances executing at the same time.
<p>
SEC is a single-threaded application, since by its design,
event correlation state is shared over *all* input sources and rulesets.
Unfortunately, maintaining consistent shared event correlation state 
between multiple threads is a non-trivial problem. 
However, if several independent event processing flows can be identified,
each flow can be assigned to a separate process which has its own
event correlation state.
Finally, if data sharing is needed in a multi-process setup,
any SEC process can easily spawn several additional instances
and communicate with them through a pipe interface.

<b>Q2: How can I use SEC with rsyslog? </b>
<p>

A: If you want to configure SEC to monitor log files which are created by
rsyslog, simply use --input command line options for specifying the paths
to log files, and --conf command line options for providing appropriate
rule files for log file monitoring.
<p>
However, if you would like to pass events from rsyslog to SEC over 
the pipe interface, you would have to provide specific configuration
options for rsyslog and SEC. The following example has been tested
with SEC-2.7.4 and rsyslog-v5.
<p>
These rsyslog configuration directives start /usr/local/bin/sec.sh
with its standard input connected to a pipe,
and use the pipe for feeding all syslog messages with either <i>auth</i>- or 
<i>authpriv</i>-facility to the standard input of /usr/local/bin/sec.sh:
<p>
<i>
$ModLoad omprog
<p>
$ActionOMProgBinary /usr/local/bin/sec.sh
<br>
auth,authpriv.* :omprog:
</i>
<p>
In /usr/local/bin/sec.sh, provide a full command line for starting
SEC, for example:
<p>
<i>
#!/bin/bash
<p>
exec /usr/local/bin/sec --conf=/etc/sec/sec.conf --notail --input=-
</i>
<p>
Please note that you have to provide SEC with the --notail option, 
in order to ensure it terminates when rsyslog closes the pipe.
Otherwise, a redundant SEC instance would stay around after
rsyslog has been restarted or shut down.
<p>
If you would like to send events to local copy of rsyslog, you can run
external tools like /usr/bin/logger from SEC. Also, on many platforms 
(e.g., Linux) rsyslog accepts messages from local programs over a UNIX 
domain socket. 
For example, the following SEC action sends to rsyslog an event 
"This is a test" which is issued with the tag <i>mytest</i>, 
<i>daemon</i>-facility and <i>info</i>-level. The example assumes that
rsyslog receives incoming messages from /dev/log socket in datagram mode:
<p>
action=udgram /dev/log <30>mytest: This is a test

<p>

<a name="3">
<b>Q3: How can I use SEC with syslog-ng? </b>
<p>

A: If you would like to monitor log files created by syslog-ng, use
--input command line options for specifying their locations, and
use --conf options for providing rule files for log file monitoring.
<p>
In order to send events from syslog-ng to SEC over the pipe interface,
use the program() destination driver. For example, with the following 
configuration syslog-ng uses a pipe for feeding SEC with all messages 
received over the port 514/udp (tested with SEC-2.7.4 and syslog-ng-3.3):
<p>
<i>
source net { udp(); };
<p>
destination sec { program("/usr/local/bin/sec --conf=/etc/sec/sec.conf --notail --input=-"); };
<p>
log { source(net); destination(sec); };
</i>
<p>
Also note that SEC must be provided with the --notail option, in order to
ensure it terminates when syslog-ng closes the pipe.
<p>

<b>Q4: Does SEC support network topology databases of HP OpenView, Tivoli, 
or some other platforms? How can I use network topology information in the
event correlation process? </b>
<p>

A: There is no support for any specific network topology database format 
in the SEC core. However, SEC allows you to integrate 
custom scripts and Perl code into SEC event flow (e.g., see SingleWithScript 
rule and 'eval' action in SEC man page). Basically, you have to write a script 
or Perl code that is able to query the topology database you have, and then 
use it from rules.

<p>

<a name="5">
<b>Q5: How can I integrate SEC with HP OpenView Network Node Manager?
</b>
<p>

A: Network Node Manager 5.0 and previous releases write all the events they
see to trapd.log file. Therefore, you just have to specify this file as input 
for SEC. Starting from version 6.0, Network Node Manager does no longer
produce trapd.log file by default. To force it to do so, you have to edit
pmd.lrf file, adding -SOV_EVENT;t option to the file:
<p>
OVs_YES_START::-SOV_EVENT;t:OVs_WELL_BEHAVED:15:PAUSE
<p>
After that, execute following commands:
<p>
ovaddobj pmd.lrf <br>
ovstop pmd<br>
ovstart pmd<br>
<p>
For producing output events from SEC, you can use Network Node Manager's
ovevent utility. For detailed information, see ov_event(5), lrf(4), and 
ovevent(1) manual pages.

<p>

<a name="6">
<b>Q6: How can I integrate SEC with HP OpenView Operations?
</b>
<p>

A: Use itostream plugin that is part of the SEC package. The plugin has
been tested with Operations 5.3, 6.0, 7.0, 8.1 and 9.2, and has been found 
working with HP-UX, Solaris and Linux management servers, but also with
HP-UX, Solaris and Linux agents.
<p>
To use the plugin, you first need to compile it. The compiling
instructions are located in the itostream.c file, but if you are compiling
on management server, the following line should be sufficient:
<p>
gcc -o itostream itostream.c -L/opt/OV/lib -lopcsv -lnsp
<p>
On agents use -DAGENT flag, e.g.,
<p>
gcc -o itostream itostream.c -DAGENT -L/opt/OV/lib -lopc -lnsp
<p>
On some agent platforms the /opt/OV/lib directory is not included in the
shared library search path, which results an error message when you try to
run itostream binary. To include /opt/OV/lib in search path, use
-Xlinker -rpath options:
<p>
gcc -o itostream itostream.c -DAGENT -L/opt/OV/lib -lopc -lnsp 
  -Xlinker -rpath /opt/OV/lib
<p>
Also, some Operations agent platforms don't have /opt/OV/lib/libopc.* 
library, which is normally just a symbolic link to
/opt/OV/lib/libopc_r.* library. In that case try
to use the following commandline:
<p>
gcc -o itostream itostream.c -DAGENT -L/opt/OV/lib -lopc_r -lnsp
<p>
(i.e., use -lopc_r option instead of -lopc).
<p>
In order to use itostream binary on the management server, you need to
enable output for external MSI plugins. To do that, open the Operations GUI
Node Bank, and go to Actions->Server->Configure. Then check "Enable Output"
option, and close the window.
<p>
If you wish to use itostream on particular Operations managed node, right-click
on the managed node icon, and go to Modify->Advanced Options. Then check 
"Enable Output" option, and close the window.
<p>
Itostream takes 2 parameters: the name of MSI interface (you can use
arbitrary string here, like "test" or "mymsi"), and timeout N -
when itostream has seen no data for the last N seconds, it will try to
reconnect to the local Operations agent or Operations management server. After
startup, itostream will write Operations messages to its standard output, one
message per line. Itostream's standard output can be directed to a pipe or
file, which can be input for SEC. Here are some sample lines from itostream
output:
<p>
time=1025713202 sev=normal node=server1.mydomain app=TEST obj=TEST msg_grp=Network msg_text=node up <br>
time=1025713224 sev=major node=server2.mydomain app=opsystem obj=disk msg_grp=OS msg_text=Disk fault <br>
time=1025713227 sev=critical node=server2.mydomain app=opsystem obj=server msg_grp=OS msg_text=node down

<p>

<b>Q7: How can I use SEC with Graphite?</b>
<p>
A: You can use the 'tcpsock' action for sending data to Graphite. By default,
Graphite listens on the port 2003/tcp for lines in plaintext format, where
each line has the following layout: 
<p>
<i>metric_path metric_value metric_timestamp</i>
<p>
For example, the line <i>switch.box2.cpu.util 100 1370349000</i> could 
represent the fact that the CPU utilization of the switch box2 was 100% at 
June 4, 2013 12:30 UTC (1370349000 seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC).
The following ruleset keeps track of SSH login failures from different client
systems, and reports the number of login failures per client IP address to
Graphite:
<p>
type=Single
<br>
ptype=RegExp
<br>
pattern=sshd\[\d+\]: Failed \S+ for (?:invalid user )?\S+ from ([\d.]+) port \d+ ssh2$
<br>
desc=SSH login failure from $1
<br>
action=lcall %o $1 -> ( sub { ++$sshlogin_failed{$_[0]}; } )
<p>
type=Calendar
<br>
time=*/5 * * * *
<br>
desc=report SSH login failure statistics
<br>
action=lcall %temp -> ( sub { return keys %sshlogin_failed; } ); \ 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; fill CLIENTS %temp; \
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; lcall %temp -> ( sub { return values %sshlogin_failed; } ); \ 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; fill COUNTS %temp; \
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; lcall %n -> ( sub { %sshlogin_failed = (); return "\n"; } ); \ 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; getsize %size CLIENTS; while %size ( \
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shift CLIENTS %client; shift COUNTS %count; \
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tcpsock localhost:2003 ssh.login.failure.%client %count %u%n; \
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getsize %size CLIENTS )
<p>
Login failure counts for clients are kept in the Perl hash table
%sshlogin_failed which is maintained by both rules.
The first rule matches an SSH login failure event, extracting the IP address
of the client and incrementing the entry for the given IP in the 
%sshlogin_failed hash table.
The second rule reports login failures per client IP addresses once in
every 5 minutes. The rule also resets the %sshlogin_failed hash table,
in order to start counting from scratch for the following 5 minutes.
<p>
During reporting, the second rule extracts client IP addresses and login 
failure counts from the %sshlogin_failed hash table,
storing these data to contexts CLIENTS and COUNTS, respectively.
Note that client IP addresses and respective counts are stored in the same
order (this is ensured by Perl's keys() and values() functions). 
For example, if the second element in the store of the CLIENTS context is 
10.1.1.1, it is also the second element in the store of COUNTS which reflects
login failures from 10.1.1.1.
In order to send collected data to Graphite, the 'while' action is used
to loop over CLIENTS and COUNTS contexts, shifting elements out from both
contexts during each iteration and sending them to Graphite with the 'tcpsock'
action. The loop is executed until the store of the CLIENTS context contains
no elements (the 'getsize' action returns 0).
<p>
Each 'tcpsock' action takes the client IP address and login failure count,
and forms the following data string: 
<p>
ssh.login.failure.<i>IPaddress</i> <i>count</i> <i>timestamp</i><b>newline</b>
<p>
The timestamp is obtained from the %u action list variable which is 
automatically maintained by SEC, while newline is assigned to the %n action
list variable with the 'lcall' action (the same action resets
the %sshlogin_failed hash table).
After creating the data string, the 'tcpsock' action sends it to the port
2003/tcp of the Graphite server (the example assumes the server is running
at the local host).

<b>Q8: How can I convert Swatch rules into SEC rules?</b>
<p>
A: The Swatch rule that consists of a regular expression and action without
thresholding conditions can be expressed with a SEC Single rule. For example,
the Swatch rule 
<p>
watchfor /sshd\[\d+\]: Failed .+ for (\w+) from [\d.]+ port \d+ ssh2$/
<br>
exec echo Login failure for user $1 
<p>
can be converted to
<p>
type=Single
<br>
ptype=Regexp
<br>
pattern=sshd\[\d+\]: Failed .+ for (\w+) from [\d.]+ port \d+ ssh2$
<br>
desc=login failure
<br>
action=write - Login failure for user $1
<p>
Suppose you have the following Swatch thresholding rule:
<p>
watchfor /sshd\[\d+\]: Failed .+ for (\w+) from [\d.]+ port \d+ ssh2$/
<br>
threshold track_by=$1,type=both,count=3,seconds=60
<br>
exec echo Three login failures for user $1 within 1m
<p>
This rule matches SSH login failure events and writes a warning to standard
output if three failed logins have been observed for the *same* user within
60 seconds.
<p>
Swatch thresholding rules can be tuned with setting the following parameters:
<p>
track_by -- scope of counting<br>
count -- event threshold<br>
seconds -- counting window<br>
type -- type of thresholding<br>
<p>
The 'type' parameter can have the following values:
<p>
limit -- react to the first 'count' events with an action and ignore 
the following ones (e.g., if count=3, react to 1st, 2nd and 3rd event)
<br>
threshold -- react to each 'count'-th event with an action 
(e.g., if count=3, react to 3rd, 6th, 9th, ... event)
<br>
both -- react to 'count'-th event with an action (e.g., if count=3, 
react to the 3rd event only)
<p>
The 'both' thresholding mode maps naturally to the SingleWithThreshold
rule of SEC. For example, the Swatch rule 
<p>
watchfor /sshd\[\d+\]: Failed .+ for (\w+) from [\d.]+ port \d+ ssh2$/
<br>
threshold track_by=$1,type=both,count=3,seconds=60
<br>
exec echo Three login failures for user $1 within 1m
<p>
can be written as follows:
<p>
type=SingleWithThreshold
<br>
ptype=Regexp
<br>
pattern=sshd\[\d+\]: Failed .+ for (\w+) from [\d.]+ port \d+ ssh2$
<br>
desc=$1
<br>
action=write - Three login failures for user $1 within 1m
<br>
thresh=3
<br>
window=60
<p>
In order to mimic the 'threshold' mode of Swatch, change the 'action'
parameter of the above SEC rule in the following way:
<p>
action=write - Three login failures for user $1 within 1m; reset 0
<p>
For thresholding similar to the Swatch 'limit' mode, use the EventGroup rule 
of SEC: 
<p>
type=EventGroup
<br>
ptype=RegExp
<br>
pattern=sshd\[\d+\]: Failed .+ for (\w+) from [\d.]+ port \d+ ssh2$
<br>
context=!SUPPRESS_SSH_USER_$1
<br>
count=write - Login failure for user $1
<br>
desc=$1
<br>
action=create SUPPRESS_SSH_USER_$1
<br>
thresh=3
<br>
window=60
<br>
end=delete SUPPRESS_SSH_USER_$1
<p>
The 'count' parameter of this rule executes an action on each matching
event, and the 'action' parameter sets up a suppressing context when 3 events
have been seen for the same user name. The context disables further matching 
for the given user name and is removed by the 'end' parameter when 
counting operation terminates for this user name.
<p>
Note that if the Swatch rule has the 'type' parameter set to 'limit' or 'both',
and the 'count' parameter is set to 1, the rule executes an action for
the first event instance and suppresses the following instances in the given
time window. Such rules are easiest to express with SEC SingleWithSuppress
rules, for example:
<p>
type=SingleWithSuppress
<br>
ptype=Regexp
<br>
pattern=sshd\[\d+\]: Failed .+ for (\w+) from [\d.]+ port \d+ ssh2$
<br>
desc=$1
<br>
action=write - Login failure for user $1, suppressing repeated events for the same user during 1m
<br>
window=60

<b>Q9: I have set up a named pipe as input file with 
--input option, but SEC is unable to open it, although SEC has a permission 
to read it. Why doesn't my setup work? </b>
<p>

A: In order to keep the pipe open at all times without the need to close
and reopen it when the writer closes the pipe, SEC opens named pipes in 
read-write mode by default. For changing this behavior, use the --norwfifo
command line option.

<p>

<a name="10">
<b>Q10: What is the difference between rules and event 
correlation operations? </b>
<p>

A: Basically, rules are instructions to SEC that tell which event correlation
to start and how to feed them with events. Rules are static in
their nature - their number will not change at runtime, unless you have
updated the configuration file(s) and sent SIGHUP or SIGABRT to SEC.
In contrast, event correlation operations are dynamic - they are started by 
rules and they terminate after their job is done.
<p>
There is no 1-1 relationship between the rules and event correlation
operations - there can be many simultaneously running event correlation 
operations that were all started by the same rule.
<p>
After the rule has started an event correlation operation, this event
correlation operation needs to be distinguished from other operations.
To do this, SEC assigns a key to the operation that is composed from
configuration file name, rule ID, and the operation description string 
(defined by the <i>desc</i> field of the rule). 
<p>
Say that you have configuration file my.conf with one rule in it:
<p>
type=SingleWithThreshold <br>
ptype=RegExp <br>
pattern=user (\S+) login failure on (\S+) <br>
desc=Repeated login failures for user $1 on $2 <br> 
action=shellcmd notify.sh "%s" <br>
window=60 <br>
thresh=3 <br>
<p>
Suppose that SEC observes input line "user admin login failure on tty1".
This matches pattern 'user (\S+) login failure on (\S+)', and SEC will
now build event correlation key for the observed event. After
replacing $1 and $2 with actual values, the <i>desc</i> field evaluates to 
the operation description string 
"Repeated login failures for user admin on tty1". 
Using the configuration file name, the rule ID, and the operation
description string for building the event correlation key will yield
the following value:
<p>
my.conf | 0 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty1
<p>
(Since the rule was the first one in the configuration file, its ID is 0. 
The ID for the second rule would be 1, for the third rule 2, etc.)
<p>
When SEC observes input line "user USERNAME login failure on TERM", it
will first calculate the key and check if there already is an event
correlation operation with that key. If such operation exists, detected line
will be correlated by this operation. Otherwise, a new event
correlation operation will be started which will consume the input line.
<p>
This processing scheme means that by using appropriate <i>desc</i> fields,
you can change the scope of event correlation.
For instance, if you use 'Repeated login failures for user $1' for 
<i>desc</i>, you will count login failures for different users,
disregarding terminal names. Therefore, the following three lines will be
correlated by the same event correlation operation:
<p>
user admin login failure on tty1 <br>
user admin login failure on tty5 <br>
user admin login failure on tty2 <br>
<p>
However, if you use 'Repeated login failures for user $1 on $2' for 
<i>desc</i>, the three lines above will each start a separate event
correlation operation.
<p>
Since the configuration file name and rule ID are present in the keys, event
correlation operations started by different rules will not clash, even if
their operation description strings are identical.

<p>

<a name="11">
<b> Q11: How can I see what event correlation operations
are currently active? How can I see the state of individual event
correlation operations? How can I see what SEC is currently doing? </b>
<p>

A: Send SIGUSR1 signal to the SEC process, this will cause SEC to dump
detailed information about its state to the dumpfile (given with --dump 
option). The information includes details about event correlation operations 
and contexts that are currently active, SEC performance and rule usage 
statistics, etc.

<p>

<a name="12">
<b>Q12: How does 'reset' action work? </b>
<p>

A: Suppose you have two rules in your configuration file my.conf:
<p>
type=Single <br>
ptype=RegExp <br>
pattern=user (\S+) logged in on (\S+) <br>
desc=User $1 successful login <br>
action=reset +1 Repeated login failures for user $1 on $2 <br>
<p>
type=SingleWithThreshold <br>
ptype=RegExp <br>
pattern=user (\S+) login failure on (\S+) <br>
desc=Repeated login failures for user $1 on $2 <br> 
action=shellcmd notify.sh "%s" <br>
window=60 <br>
thresh=3 <br>
<p>
Suppose SEC will observe the following lines:
<p>
user admin login failure on tty1 <br>
user admin login failure on tty5 <br>
user admin login failure on tty2 <br>
<p>
The second rule will start a separate event correlation operation for each
of the lines. The keys of these operations are:
<p>
my.conf | 1 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty1 <br>
my.conf | 1 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5 <br>
my.conf | 1 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty2 <br>
<p>
(since the rule was the second one in the configuration file, its ID is 1).
<p>
When SEC will observe the line 'user admin logged in on tty5', it will
evaluate $1 and $2 variables, yielding the following action:
<p>
reset +1 Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5
<p>
This means that SEC has to terminate the operation which has been started 
by the next rule (+1) and which has the key 
<p>
my.conf | 1 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5
<p>
Since the terms "next to the first" and "second" are identical, 
another way to write the same action is:
<p>
action=reset 2 Repeated login failures for user $1 on $2
<p>
If there is no rule number specified in the action definition, e.g.
<p>
action=reset Repeated login failures for user $1 on $2
<p>
then SEC will assume a wildcard for the rule number, constructing all 
possible keys and trying to find and terminate corresponding operations.
If there are 5 rules in the configuration file, SEC would look for the
operations with the following keys:
<p>
my.conf | 0 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5 <br>
my.conf | 1 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5 <br>
my.conf | 2 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5 <br>
my.conf | 3 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5 <br>
my.conf | 4 | Repeated login failures for user admin on tty5 <br>

<p>

<a name="13">
<b>Q13: How can I use regular expression modifiers in SEC rule definitions 
(like //i, //m, etc.)? </b>
<p>

A: SEC regular expression definitions don't include surrounding slashes, and
therefore it looks like there is no place for modifiers. Fortunately, perl
regular expressions allow you to use modifiers inside regular expressions:
<p>
/your_regexp/i can be expressed as /(?i)your_regexp/ <br>
/your_regexp/m can be expressed as /(?m)your_regexp/ <br>
etc. <br> 
(see perlre(1) man page)<br>
<p>
For example, if you would like to set 'pattern' field to /[A-Z]/i, 
correct way of doing that would be 'pattern=(?i)[A-Z]'.

<b>Q14: How can I load Perl modules that could be used at SEC runtime?</b>
<p>
A: Add --intevents option to SEC commandline, and write a rule for loading 
the necessary module when SEC_STARTUP event is observed. The following
rule will load the SNMP module, and terminate SEC if the loading failed:
<p>
type=single <br>
ptype=substr <br>
pattern=SEC_STARTUP <br>
context=SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT <br>
desc=Load SNMP module <br>
action=assign %a 0; eval %a (require SNMP); eval %a (exit(1) unless %a) <br>
<p>
Note that before attempting to load the SNMP module, the %a variable will be 
set to zero, since if the SEC 'eval' action fails, it will not change the 
previous value of its variable. Therefore, if %a is still zero after the load 
attempt, the attempt was not successful.

<b>Q15: How can I save contexts to disk when SEC is shut down, 
and read them in after SEC has been restarted? </b>
<p>
A: Add --intevents option to SEC commandline, and write rules for saving
context names when SEC_SHUTDOWN event is observed and for reading context
names in when SEC_STARTUP event is observed. For writing context names into
a file, use SingleWithScript rule:
<p>
# save context names 
<p>
type=SingleWithScript <br>
ptype=SubStr <br>
pattern=SEC_SHUTDOWN <br>
context=SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT <br>
script=cat > /tmp/sec_contexts.dump <br>
desc=Saving the SEC contexts <br>
action=none <br>
<p>
# read in context names, prepending 'SEC_CONTEXT: ' prefix to every name
<p>
type=Single <br>
ptype=SubStr <br>
pattern=SEC_STARTUP <br>
context=SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT <br>
desc=Read in previously saved SEC contexts <br>
action=spawn perl -ne 'print "SEC_CONTEXT: $_"' /tmp/sec_contexts.dump <br>
<p>
# Create contexts, based on the information received from the previous rule
<p>
type=Single <br>
ptype=RegExp <br>
pattern=^SEC_CONTEXT: (.*) <br>
desc=Recreate context $1 <br>
action=create $1 <br>
<p>
The following ruleset loads Perl Storable module at SEC startup and uses 
it for saving/restoring all context data (context names, their lifetimes
event stores, etc.):
<p>
type=Single <br>
ptype=SubStr <br>
pattern=SEC_STARTUP <br>
context=SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT <br>
continue=TakeNext <br>
desc=Load the Storable module and terminate if it is not found <br>
action=assign %ret 0; eval %ret (require Storable); \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  eval %ret (exit(1) unless %ret) <br>
<p>
type=Single <br>
ptype=SubStr <br>
pattern=SEC_STARTUP <br>
context=SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT <br>
desc=Restore all SEC contexts from /tmp/SEC_CONTEXTS on startup <br>
action=lcall %ret -> ( sub { \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  my $ptr = $main::context_list{"SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT"}; \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  %main::context_list = \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  %{Storable::retrieve("/tmp/SEC_CONTEXTS")}; \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  $main::context_list{"SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT"} = $ptr; } ) <br>
<p>
type=Single <br>
ptype=SubStr <br>
pattern=SEC_SHUTDOWN <br>
context=SEC_INTERNAL_EVENT <br>
desc=Save all SEC contexts into /tmp/SEC_CONTEXTS on shutdown <br>
action=lcall %ret -> ( sub { \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Storable::store(\%main::context_list, "/tmp/SEC_CONTEXTS"); } ) <br>

<b>Q16: How can I set up bi-directional communication between SEC and 
its subprocess that was started by 'spawn' action?</b>
<p>
A: When another process is started with 'spawn' from SEC,
it can send data to SEC by writing to standard output (internally, the
standard output of the process is redirected to a pipe that SEC reads).
To send data from SEC to the spawned process, set up a named pipe or file 
from the process and use the 'write' action for writing to that pipe or file.

<b>Q17: How can I run 'shellcmd' actions in an ordered manner (i.e., 
an action is not started before the previous one has completed)?</b>
<p>
A: Suppose you have the following rule definition:
<p>
type=Calendar <br>
time=0 0 * * * <br>
desc=Sending report <br>
action=shellcmd cat /tmp/myreport | mail root@localhost; \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  shellcmd rm -f /tmp/myreport <br>
<p>
Since the runtime of external programs started with the 'shellcmd' actions 
is not limited in any way, SEC creates a separate process for executing
each program, in order to avoid freezing the whole event processing. 
Therefore, although the first action
(cat /tmp/myreport | mail root@localhost) is started before the second one
(rm -f /tmp/myreport), it is not guaranteed that the first action has already 
terminated when the second action starts. Furthermore, since commandlines 
are first processed by the shell, it could well happen that the second action 
is actually executed first, especially if its commandline is much simpler and
takes less time to process.
Therefore, the rule definition above might easily produce an empty e-mail 
message, since the file is removed just before 'cat' gets to it.
<p>
In order to avoid such unwanted behaviour, you could use single 'shellcmd' 
action and take advantage of the shell's && control operator:
<p>
type=Calendar <br>
time=0 0 * * * <br>
desc=Sending report <br>
action=shellcmd cat /tmp/myreport | mail root@localhost && rm -f /tmp/myreport <br>
<p>
i.e., the file /tmp/myreport is not removed before the 'mail' command has 
completed successfully. Another way to solve this problem is to put all
your commands into a separate shell script, and give the name of the script
to the 'shellcmd' action.

<b>Q18: I have started a long-running subprocess from SEC, but when I 
send SIGHUP or SIGTERM to SEC, the subprocess will not receive SIGTERM as it 
should. What can be done about it?</b>
<p>
A: When a command is started from Perl with system() or open() call, 
Perl checks whether the command contains shell metacharacters, and if
it does, the command is executed with the interpreting shell 
(on UNIX platforms, normally with <i>/bin/sh -c your_command</i>).
This means that when SEC is sending SIGTERM to its child processes, 
<i>your_command</i> will NOT receive SIGTERM, but it will be sent to the shell
that started it.
<p>
In order to avoid such unwanted behaviour (and save one slot
in your process table), use shell's <i>exec</i> builtin command. 
When <i>exec</i> is prependend to your commandline, the shell will not
fork a separate process for your command, but it will be executed
inside the current process. E.g., when you specify
<p>
action=spawn exec /usr/local/bin/myscript.pl 2>/var/log/myscript.log
<p>
an extra process will not be created for myscript.pl, although the
commandline contains the shell redirection metacharacter '>'.

<b>Q19: How can I write a rule for several input sources 
that would be able to report the name of the source for matching lines?
How to report the name of the internal context for input source? </b>
<p>
A: Starting from SEC-2.6.1, you can take advantage of the $+{_inputsrc}
match variable that holds the name(s) of input source(s) for matching line(s).
With earlier versions of SEC,
use the PerlFunc pattern type that has the input source name as one of its 
input parameters, and return the input source name from the pattern function.
E.g., the following rule matches the "File system full" messages with
a regular expression, and sets $1 and $2 variables to the file system and input
source names:
<p>
type=single <br>
ptype=perlfunc <br>
pattern=sub { if ($_[0] =~ /(\S+): [Ff]ile system full/) { \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  return ($1, $_[1]); } else { return 0; } } <br>
desc=File system $1 full ($2) <br>
action=write - <br>
<p>
If the "/opt: file system full" message is logged to /var/log/server1.log,
the rule writes "File system /opt full (/var/log/server1.log)" to standard
output.
<p>
For obtaining the name of the internal context for the current input source,
you can access the internal context data structure that is referred by
$int_events variable in the SEC code, and get the keys of the hash table 
$int_events->{"Aliases"} (the hash table contains only one key which is 
the name of the internal context for the current input source).
E.g., the following rule matches all events and if --intcontexts command
line option is present, it prints to standard output the names of the current
input source and its internal context:
<p>
type=single <br>
ptype=regexp <br>
pattern=. <br>
desc=match any event and print the names of its input source and context <br>
action=lcall %context -> ( sub { keys %{$main::int_context->{"Aliases"}} } ); \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write - got input event from file $+{_inputsrc}, context %context <br>
<p>
For example, if SEC is started with the command line option 
--input=/var/log/messages=TEST and SEC reads a new line from /var/log/messages,
the above rule writes "got input event from file /var/log/messages, context TEST"
to standard output.

<b>Q20: How can I limit the run time of child processes?</b>
<p>
A: First, you can schedule the delivery of the ALRM signal for the child 
process with the alarm(2) system call. For example, the following 'shellcmd' 
action starts /bin/myprog which will get the ALRM signal after 10 seconds 
and terminate (provided that no custom handler has been set for ALRM in
/bin/myprog):
<p>
action=shellcmd ( perl -e 'alarm(10); exec("/bin/myprog")' )
<p>
If you would like to be able to use other signals for terminating child
processes, you could use the following fairly simple Perl wrapper script:
<p>
<i>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
<p>
if (scalar(@ARGV) < 3) { exit(1); }
<br>
$int = shift @ARGV;
<br>
$sig = shift @ARGV;
<p>
$pid = fork(); 
<p>
if ($pid == -1) { 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  exit(1);  
<br>
} elsif ($pid == 0) { 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  exec("@ARGV");  
<br>
} else { 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  $SIG{ALRM} = sub { kill $sig, $pid; exit(0); }; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  $SIG{TERM} = sub { kill TERM, $pid; exit(0); }; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  alarm($int); 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  waitpid($pid, 0); 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  exit($? >> 8); 
<br>
}  
</i>
<p>
The following 'shellcmd' action will invoke /bin/prog through this wrapper
and terminate it after 15 seconds with the KILL signal:
<p>
action=shellcmd /usr/local/bin/wrapper.pl 15 9 /bin/myprog
